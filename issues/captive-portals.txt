Adam Langley pointed out a serious problem with captive portals, which is that
a successful SK lookup would be needed before loading the (often HTTPS)
authentication page that they send hijacked users to.  

Two possible solutions to this problem:

1. Enumerate and whitelist the set of captive portal domains.  We could do
   this by instrumenting a widely deployed browser to spot these domains.

2. Try to detect the characteristic behaviour of captive portals, and if one
   is present, temporarily whitelist the HTTPS domain that the user is 
   redirected to when they send an http request to to hijack-me.com, but 
   only if they haven't cached an SK for that domain (if they have cached 
   one, they should expect a cross-signature from it).

   This could be combined with UI chrome to indicate "you are being hijacked,
   your browser is in a low security state".
