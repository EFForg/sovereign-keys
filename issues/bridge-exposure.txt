The SK spec indicates that Tor hidden services could be used as a fallback
mechanism for users who are affected by MITM or connection blocking attacks.

On particularly hostile networks, it is presumed that these users would
access the Tor network via Tor bridges or similar tunneling mechanisms.
Unfortunately, this probably gives network attackers a way of detecting the
bridges.

For example, if a network attacker is trying to censor
yourdomain.bloghosting.com, they can observe (via SNI, for instance) that Alice
is trying to connect to that domain.  They may then MITM or block her
connection, in which case Alice's SK client will fall back to a Tor bridge to
connect to yourdomain.bloghoster.com's hidden service.  But at that moment,
the attacker knows Alice's client will be doing this, and they can interdict
the connection to the bridge, and learn the IP of a bridge relay to boot.
