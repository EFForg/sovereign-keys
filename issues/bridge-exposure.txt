The SK spec indicates that Tor hidden services could be used as a fallback
mechanism for users who are affected by MITM or connection blocking attacks.

On particularly hostile networks, it is presumed that these users would
access the Tor network via Tor bridges or similar tunneling mechanisms.
Unfortunately, this probably gives network attackers a way of detecting the
bridges.

For example, if a network attacker is trying to censor
yourdomain.bloghosting.com, they can observe (via SNI, for instance) that Alice
is trying to connect to that domain.  They may then MITM or block her
connection, in which case Alice's SK client will fall back to a Tor bridge to
connect to yourdomain.bloghoster.com's hidden service.  But at that moment,
the attacker knows Alice's client will be doing this, and they can interdict
the connection to the bridge, and learn the IP of a bridge relay to boot.

Available mitigation strategies:

  - Allow domain holders to specify that on certain networks, the first
    connection should not be vanilla TLS.  For instance, "if you are in Iran,
    start with my .onion address".  This might be a nice/useful feature at
    some point, but it doesn't completely solve the attack: the attacker can
    target any connection that it knows will fall back to circumvention, not
    just those that are playing cat-and-mouse.

  - Use circumvention techniques that are at least somewhat tolerant to giving
    the attacker an oracle for circumvention connections.  Telex may or may
    nott be such a technique.

  - Use circumvention techniques in an all-or-nothing way.  If you're using
    telex, or obfsproxy, or some other thing, all TLS traffic needs to go
    through it.  Hopefully this does not imply the same kind of latency hit as
    tor!
