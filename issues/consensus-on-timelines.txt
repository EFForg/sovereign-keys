The renegation tracking and sychronisation method specified in Section 3 of
the design assumes that all implementations agree on a finite and moderately
sized set of timeline servers that might once have been used.

This is clearly very easy to achieve if, for instance, all implementations
are willing to defer to one implementation on this question.

It is an open question whether we need to support greater degrees of
decentralisation.
