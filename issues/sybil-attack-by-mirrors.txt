In the algorithm specified in Section 4.b., there is a possible Sybil attack
which could occur if an attacker could add mirrors to the GOOD_MIRRORS list
faster than the client could notice them being bad.

The 4.b. algorithm could have an extra failure case to prevent this
(having failure for one name entail failure for all names would achieve this).

The alternative is to police the GOOD_MIRRORS list in some way that is
minimally rate limiting.
