Attack: a country blocks requests to all mirrors except a subset that falsely
        omits certain sovereign key entries after a time T.

Defense: with small probability, make an async copy of your mirror query
         through Tor.  This way, clients will notice these attacks and cease
         trusting those mirrors.

Question: how bad would performance become if all mirror queries had
to be torified?
